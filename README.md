# Course Scheduler

This project contains a Java Swing application used for managing course schedules. It was developed as part of the CMSC221 course at Penn State.

## Features

- Maintain a list of semesters, students, courses and classes
- Schedule students into classes with automatic waitlisting
- Drop students or entire classes and update waitlists accordingly
- Display class rosters and individual schedules

Data is stored in an embedded Apache Derby database. The application can be built and run using [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org/) together with the NetBeans project files included in the `nbproject` directory.
